# H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccine Predictions
I was enrolled in a Machine Learning competition of [Driven Data website](https://www.drivendata.org/). 

The site host ML competitions —similar to Kaggle— with thousands of professional and students of Data Science.

This was my first attempt in the competition.
