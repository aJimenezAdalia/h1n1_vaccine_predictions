# H1N1 and Seasonal Flu Vaccine Predictions
I was enrolled in a Machine Learning competition of [Driven Data website](https://www.drivendata.org/). 

The site host ML competitions —similar to Kaggle— with thousands of professional and students of Data Science.

This was my first attempt in the competition.

## The competition
The challenge is to estimate the individual probability of receive each vaccine (H1N1 and Flu).

## Data
Data is provided courtesy of the United States [National Center of Health Statistics](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/index.htm)

## Results
The metric used for this competition is ROC AUC Score.
The leaders are getting around 0.86 ROC AUC, and we were able to reach 0.83. With this score, we are in the world top 25%.
